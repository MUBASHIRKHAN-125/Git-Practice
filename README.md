## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository
This repository is created for practicing Git commands and workflows.
I am learning Git to improve my version control skills, which are essential for collaboration, tracking code changes, and working on real-world projects.

The goal is to get comfortable with:

Branching and merging

Staging and committing changes

Resolving conflicts

Working with remote repositories

This hands-on practice will help me use Git confidently in future development projects.
